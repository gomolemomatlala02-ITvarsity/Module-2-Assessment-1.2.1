                    <h3>GEMSBOKS</h3>
                    <p>Gemsbok, (Oryx gazella), species of oryx, or large antelope, that lives in desert regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Gemsbok are the largest species of oryx and are powerfully built, with sturdy, muscular bodies. They are known in particular for their striking coloration, being gray-brown with contrasting black and white markings on the face and legs and a long black tail. They also have remarkable horns, which are long, straight, and backward-pointing.</p> 
                    <p>Gemsbok stand up to 138 cm (54 inches) tall at the shoulder. Bulls weigh between about 230 and 250 kg (500 and 550 pounds), while cows weigh about 200 kg (440 pounds). Gemsbok of both sexes have horns, which can reach lengths of 120 cm (47 inches). The horns are used as defensive weapons against predators such as lions, African wild dogs, and hyenas. Bulls also use their horns to fight each other.</p>
                    <P>Gemsbok mostly eat grasses. They also dig for roots and tubers that store water. They can go for a long time without drinking and are well adapted to hot, dry regions. They prefer rocky plains but can survive in rocky hills and in areas as dry as the Kalahari Desert. Gemsbok live in herds of 10 to 40 animals and can live up to 20 years. Starting at the age of about 2.5 years, a female gives birth to a single calf.</P>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                   <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
